# A Collaborative BlogPost Site

A web application made uisng the java spring-boot framework, following the MVC architecture.

### How it works:
Users can create blogs, reffered to as "docs" in the application. Other users can request access to your docs. These requests will be visible below the list of docs available on the app. You can grant access to read or write.

### How to run:
1. Clone the repo and open it in IntelliJ IDE
2. Run the application
3. Open multiple tabs to the same localhost port to represent multiple users. (Alternatively, for a better demonstration, connect multiple devices to the same local network and access the application through the IP address of the machine running it.)
Note: Pages must be refreshed to reflect updates.
