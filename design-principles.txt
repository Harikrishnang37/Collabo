Based on the provided UML class diagram, the following design principles can be observed:

Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): Each class or interface in the diagram appears to have a well-defined responsibility. For example, the UserEntity class represents user data, the Document class represents document data, and the AccessRequest class represents access request data. Similarly, the service interfaces, such as UserService, DocumentService, and AccessRequestService, have specific responsibilities for managing their respective entities.
Interface Segregation Principle (ISP): The diagram shows several interfaces, such as UserRepository, DocumentRepository, AccessRequestRepository, UserService, DocumentService, and AccessRequestService. These interfaces define specific contracts and responsibilities, allowing for better segregation of concerns and promoting loose coupling between components.
Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP): The diagram follows the Dependency Inversion Principle, where higher-level modules (e.g., controllers) depend on abstractions (e.g., services) rather than concrete implementations. For example, the DocumentController depends on the DocumentService interface, and the UserController depends on the UserService interface. This principle promotes loose coupling and improves the maintainability and testability of the codebase.
Open/Closed Principle (OCP): The use of interfaces and abstract classes in the diagram suggests adherence to the Open/Closed Principle. By defining interfaces and implementing classes separately, the system is open for extension (e.g., adding new implementations) but closed for modification (e.g., modifying existing interfaces or abstract classes).
Separation of Concerns (SoC): The diagram demonstrates a clear separation of concerns by dividing the system into different layers: entities (data models), repositories (data access), services (business logic), and controllers (presentation logic). This separation promotes modularity, maintainability, and testability of the codebase.
Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY): The diagram suggests that the DRY principle is followed by defining abstractions (interfaces) and implementing classes separately. This allows for code reuse and avoids duplication of logic across multiple classes.
Information Expert Principle: The diagram appears to follow the Information Expert Principle, where classes are responsible for the data they encapsulate. For example, the DocumentService manages document-related operations, the UserService handles user-related operations, and the AccessRequestService deals with access request-related operations.
Encapsulation: The diagram shows that data and behavior are encapsulated within classes, promoting data hiding and providing controlled access to class members through well-defined interfaces or public methods.
